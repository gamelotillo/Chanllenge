It has been classified as problematic. This affects the function xstrdup of the file libiberty/xmalloc.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-1121","epss":0.01654,"percentile":0.81421,"date":"2025-11-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-1121","cwe":"CWE-367","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2018-1121","cwe":"CWE-362","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1121","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-12928","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12928","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel 4.15.0, a NULL pointer dereference was discovered in hfs_ext_read_extent in hfs.ko.

That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function, link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.  After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.  That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.

For attributes that control queue limits, the store operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to queue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may need to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the hardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA deadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing the device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the device queue limits.  Avoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the ->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the queue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking the limits lock.  This also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as it doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting. Hopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.

However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21807","epss":0.00029,"percentile":0.07205,"date":"2025-11-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21807","cwe":"CWE-667","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21807","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-21833","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21833","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Avoid use of NULL after WARN_ON_ONCE  There is a WARN_ON_ONCE to catch an unlikely situation when domain_remove_dev_pasid can't find the `pasid`.

Let's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and Thread B is trying to remove the bridge.  In dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by netdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call() also re-acquires RTNL.

In the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:    1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()   2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()   3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()   4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()  3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move 1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().  Note that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better performed before RTNL.  SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since the pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process them there.

Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL\nand wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.\n\nThread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),\nwhich may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by\nThread B.\n\n  Thread A (SIOCBRDELIF)           Thread B (SIOCBRDELBR)\n  ----------------------           ----------------------\n  sock_ioctl                       sock_ioctl\n  `- sock_do_ioctl                 `- br_ioctl_call\n     `- dev_ioctl                     `- br_ioctl_stub\n        |- rtnl_lock                     |\n        |- dev_ifsioc                    '\n        '  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n           |- netdev_hold(dev, ...)      .\n       /   |- rtnl_unlock  ------.       |\n       |   |- br_ioctl_call       `--->  |- rtnl_lock\n  Race |   |  `- br_ioctl_stub           |- br_del_bridge\n  Window   |     |                       |  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n       |   |     |  May take long        |  `- br_dev_delete(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |  under RTNL pressure  |     `- unregister_netdevice_queue(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |               |       `- rtnl_unlock\n       \\   |     |- rtnl_lock  <-'          `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     |- ...                        `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     `- rtnl_unlock                   |- __rtnl_unlock\n           |                                      |- netdev_wait_allrefs_any\n           |- netdev_put(dev, ...)  <----------------'\n                                                Wait refcnt decrement\n                                                and log splat below\n\nTo avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call\ndev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nIn the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:\n\n  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()\n  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()\n  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()\n  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()\n\n3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move\n1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().\n\nNote that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better\nperformed before RTNL.\n\nSIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since\nthe pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process\nthem there.\n\n[0]:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for wpan3 to become free.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics  Driver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and standalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from the buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the ppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor mode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is captured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.  When the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is activated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics, the driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter configuration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a memory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while enabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while enabling extended statistics mode in the driver.  Fix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling.

Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096, addr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to expand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the merged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to the merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use set_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite the newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.

Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096,\naddr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to\nexpand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the\nmerged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to\nthe merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use\nset_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite\nthe newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.\n\nSince the uprobe pte will be remapped to the merged vma, we can remove the\nunnecessary uprobe_mmap upon merged vma.\n\nThis problem was first found in linux-6.6.y and also exists in the\ncommunity syzkaller:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ada39605a5e71711@google.com/T/","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38207","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.09772,"date":"2025-11-07"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38207","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38234","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38234","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task  Overview ======== When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues.

If the socket has a tiny buffer, however, we read out the data sooner, to prevent connection stalls. Make sure that we abort the connection when we find out late that the record is actually invalid.

This function was introduced as part of handling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.  It works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the total number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program was executed.  If the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in ice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added as fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a fragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't call ice_put_rx_buf().  Because we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the page or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't increment next_to_alloc.  The ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented properly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since this function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top of the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.  Note that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The ice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a single-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear precisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes, but it happens somewhat regularly with \"jumbo frames\" used by 9K MTU.  To fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on all buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a similar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic also in ice_get_pgcnts().  Instead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which iterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just past the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does call ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of packet.  For non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting the pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of the frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only update the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still remaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for fragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.  The xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and only once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from ice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function directly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra bit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.  Move the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before* all calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic requires the index of the element just after the current frame.

Root destruction waits for offline completion, but offline work is\n   blocked behind root destruction in cgroup_destroy_wq (max_active=1)\n\nSolution:\nSplit cgroup_destroy_wq into three dedicated workqueues:\ncgroup_offline_wq – Handles CSS offline operations\ncgroup_release_wq – Manages resource release\ncgroup_free_wq – Performs final memory deallocation\n\nThis separation eliminates blocking in the CSS free path while waiting for\noffline operations to complete.\n\n[1] https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/runtest/controllers","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-39953","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.0956,"date":"2025-11-07"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-39953","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-39955","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-39955","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: Clear tcp_sk(sk)->fastopen_rsk in tcp_disconnect().  syzbot reported the splat below where a socket had tcp_sk(sk)->fastopen_rsk in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommufd: Fix race during abort for file descriptors  fput() doesn't actually call file_operations release() synchronously, it puts the file on a work queue and it will be released eventually.  This is normally fine, except for iommufd the file and the iommufd_object are tied to gether. The file has the object as it's private_data and holds a users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as the file is.  When the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it will fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This causes a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to decrement the users refcount.  Fix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call __fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before kfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object implementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file pointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: mcba_usb: populate ndo_change_mtu() to prevent buffer overflow  Sending an PF_PACKET allows to bypass the CAN framework logic and to directly reach the xmit() function of a CAN driver. The only check which is performed by the PF_PACKET framework is to make sure that skb->len fits the interface's MTU.  Unfortunately, because the mcba_usb driver does not populate its net_device_ops->ndo_change_mtu(), it is possible for an attacker to configure an invalid MTU by doing, for example:    $ ip link set can0 mtu 9999  After doing so, the attacker could open a PF_PACKET socket using the ETH_P_CANXL protocol:  \tsocket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_CANXL))  to inject a malicious CAN XL frames. For example:  \tstruct canxl_frame frame = { \t\t.flags = 0xff, \t\t.len = 2048, \t};  The CAN drivers' xmit() function are calling can_dev_dropped_skb() to check that the skb is valid, unfortunately under above conditions, the malicious packet is able to go through can_dev_dropped_skb() checks:    1. the skb->protocol is set to ETH_P_CANXL which is valid (the      function does not check the actual device capabilities).    2. the length is a valid CAN XL length.  And so, mcba_usb_start_xmit() receives a CAN XL frame which it is not able to correctly handle and will thus misinterpret it as a CAN frame.  This can result in a buffer overflow. The driver will consume cf->len as-is with no further checks on these lines:  \tusb_msg.dlc = cf->len;  \tmemcpy(usb_msg.data, cf->data, usb_msg.dlc);  Here, cf->len corresponds to the flags field of the CAN XL frame.

However, cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel the work item if it is already executing. While destroy_workqueue() does wait for all pending work items in the work queue to complete before destroying the work queue, it cannot prevent the delayed work item from being rescheduled within the ocelot_check_stats_work() function. This limitation exists because the delayed work item is only enqueued into the work queue after its timer expires. Before the timer expiration, destroy_workqueue() has no visibility of this pending work item. Once the work queue appears empty, destroy_workqueue() proceeds with destruction.

This results in reads from shadow memory beyond the end of the\nbuffer's shadow memory, which crashes when that memory is not mapped.\n\nTo fix this, correctly align the shadow address before accessing the 4\nshadow bytes corresponding to each origin.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-40008","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.05067,"date":"2025-11-07"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-40008","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-40009","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40009","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/proc/task_mmu: check p->vec_buf for NULL  When the PAGEMAP_SCAN ioctl is invoked with vec_len = 0 reaches pagemap_scan_backout_range(), kernel panics with null-ptr-deref:  [   44.936808] Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC KASAN NOPTI [   44.937797] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007] [   44.938391] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 2480 Comm: reproducer Not tainted 6.17.0-rc6 #22 PREEMPT(none) [   44.939062] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014 [   44.939935] RIP: 0010:pagemap_scan_thp_entry.isra.0+0x741/0xa80  <snip registers, unreliable trace>  [   44.946828] Call Trace: [   44.947030]  <TASK> [   44.949219]  pagemap_scan_pmd_entry+0xec/0xfa0 [   44.952593]  walk_pmd_range.isra.0+0x302/0x910 [   44.954069]  walk_pud_range.isra.0+0x419/0x790 [   44.954427]  walk_p4d_range+0x41e/0x620 [   44.954743]  walk_pgd_range+0x31e/0x630 [   44.955057]  __walk_page_range+0x160/0x670 [   44.956883]  walk_page_range_mm+0x408/0x980 [   44.958677]  walk_page_range+0x66/0x90 [   44.958984]  do_pagemap_scan+0x28d/0x9c0 [   44.961833]  do_pagemap_cmd+0x59/0x80 [   44.962484]  __x64_sys_ioctl+0x18d/0x210 [   44.962804]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x290 [   44.963111]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e  vec_len = 0 in pagemap_scan_init_bounce_buffer() means no buffers are allocated and p->vec_buf remains set to NULL.

Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.\n\nHere is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.\n\n[   20.650953] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using dummy_hcd\n[   20.830206] usb 1-1: Using ep0 maxpacket: 8\n[   20.833501] usb 1-1: config 0 descriptor??\n[   21.038518] usb 1-1: string descriptor 0 read error: -71\n[   21.038893] usb 1-1: Found UVC 0.00 device <unnamed> (2833:0201)\n[   21.039299] uvcvideo 1-1:0.0: Entity type for entity Output 1 was not initialized!\n[   21.041583] uvcvideo 1-1:0.0: Entity type for entity Input 1 was not initialized!\n[   21.042218] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   21.042536] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at drivers/media/mc/mc-entity.c:1147 media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0\n[   21.043195] Modules linked in:\n[   21.043535] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 9 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7-00030-g3480e43aeccf #444\n[   21.044101] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[   21.044639] Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\n[   21.045100] RIP: 0010:media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0\n[   21.045508] Code: fe e8 20 01 00 00 b8 f4 ff ff ff 48 83 c4 30 5b 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 5f 5d c3 cc cc cc cc 0f 0b eb e9 0f 0b eb 0a 0f 0b eb 06 <0f> 0b eb 02 0f 0b b8 ea ff ff ff eb d4 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00\n[   21.046801] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000004b318 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[   21.047227] RAX: ffff888004e5d458 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: ffffffff818fccf1\n[   21.047719] RDX: 000000000000007b RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff888004313290\n[   21.048241] RBP: ffff888004313290 R08: 0001ffffffffffff R09: 0000000000000000\n[   21.048701] R10: 0000000000000013 R11: 0001888004313290 R12: 0000000000000003\n[   21.049138] R13: ffff888004313080 R14: ffff888004313080 R15: 0000000000000000\n[   21.049648] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88803ec00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[   21.050271] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[   21.050688] CR2: 0000592cc27635b0 CR3: 000000000431c000 CR4: 0000000000750ef0\n[   21.051136] PKRU: 55555554\n[   21.051331] Call Trace:\n[   21.051480]  <TASK>\n[   21.051611]  ?

Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer to vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma->vm_flags.  The inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise() with MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode, it accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of vma->vm_flags.  Assuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and int are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &= ~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.  VM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000.  After ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then promoted to unsigned long before the & operation.  This promotion fills upper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and even for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0). & operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff instead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears the upper 32-bits of its value.  Fix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the BIT() macro.  Note: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the VM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int and after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted to unsigned long with leading 1s.

This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n& operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: rust bindgen wasn't able to handle BIT(), from Miguel]","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-40040","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.05067,"date":"2025-11-07"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-40040","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-40042","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40042","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix race condition in kprobe initialization causing NULL pointer dereference  There is a critical race condition in kprobe initialization that can lead to NULL pointer dereference and kernel crash.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix crypto buffers in non-linear memory  The crypto API, through the scatterlist API, expects input buffers to be in linear memory.  We handle this with the cifs_sg_set_buf() helper that converts vmalloc'd memory to their corresponding pages.  However, when we allocate our aead_request buffer (@creq in smb2ops.c::crypt_message()), we do so with kvzalloc(), which possibly puts aead_request->__ctx in vmalloc area.  AEAD algorithm then uses ->__ctx for its private/internal data and operations, and uses sg_set_buf() for such data on a few places.  This works fine as long as @creq falls into kmalloc zone (small requests) or vmalloc'd memory is still within linear range.  Tasks' stacks are vmalloc'd by default (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), so too many tasks will increment the base stacks' addresses to a point where virt_addr_valid(buf) will fail (BUG() in sg_set_buf()) when that happens.  In practice: too many parallel reads and writes on an encrypted mount will trigger this bug.  To fix this, always alloc @creq with kmalloc() instead. Also drop the @sensitive_size variable/arguments since kfree_sensitive() doesn't need it.

However this expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in the current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have not added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do not have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.  The insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree happens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper insert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction handle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as part of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation if we are low on free space).  So remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block group tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this case.

However\nthis expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in\nthe current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have\nnot added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do\nnot have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.\n\nThe insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree\nhappens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper\ninsert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction\nhandle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as\npart of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation\nif we are low on free space).\n\nSo remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block\ngroup tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this\ncase.\n\nSyzbot reported

Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec\nand ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.\n\nNew mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API\nrevision, as API version of OOT PF & VF drivers is already increased to\n1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.\n\nFeatures negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new\nfeatures when needed in the future.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-40104","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.05067,"date":"2025-11-07"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.48-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-40104","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a57f2fc189b9da35","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.48-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/linux-libc-dev/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list","layerID":"sha256:5b9069b55b4a719942b17aff298897d33fb9e8dfaafbfbc2a6f2987710926066","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-libc-dev.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+-or-X11","LGPL-2.1","Unicode-data","Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.48-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.48-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-40105","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40105","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfs: Don't leak disconnected dentries on umount  When user calls open_by_handle_at() on some inode that is not cached, we will create disconnected dentry for it.
